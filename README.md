# Background 
Chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) are ozone depleting substances that were used until 1985
as a cheap propellant in aerosols or in refrigerants. This molecule can be transported to
the stratosphere (upper 30-35 km of the atmosphere) and destroy the ozone catalytically.
While scientists suspected that CFCs could create an ozone hole as early as in the 1970s,
it is not until 1989 that a global ban was put into place, known as the Montreal Protocol.
To model how CFCs travel from the troposphere (bottom 10-15 km of the atmosphere)
to the stratosphere, and how they destroy ozone (O3), we use a set of coupled ODEs.
